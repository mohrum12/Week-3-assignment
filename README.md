# Week-3-assignment
What’s inside: 
nyc_key_west_actual_days_miles.ipynb – Jupyter notebook that:
* builds a pandas.Series from cumulative (odometer) readings,
* computes DailyMiles via .diff(),
* ensures the final cumulative equals 1,664.9 mi (adds/adjusts final day as needed),
* (optional) estimates EstHours per day using total hours (default 145 hr),
* shows a clean table and simple charts (daily & cumulative miles).

It took 24 days to ride 1664.9 miles from NYC to Key West.
Average miles/day: 69.37
Biggest day: Day 10 with 85.00 miles
Average speed (trip-level): 11.48 mph → target hours: 145 hr
Estimated total hours from daily breakdown: 145.03 hr
